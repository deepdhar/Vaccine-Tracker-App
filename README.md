## Motive behind
The sudden rise of 2nd wave made all of us vulnerable to the virus leaving us with no other choice but get vaccinated. Since vaccination drives aren't properly known to people, I decide to make this app which tells the users about vaccination drives going around him/her, and available slots.

## Key Features
1. Gives data about vaccination drive around
2. Takes pincode and date input from the user
3. Directs the user to book slots for vaccination from the official govt. site

## Tech Stack
